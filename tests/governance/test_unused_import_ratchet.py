"""Tests for ``scripts/unused_import_ratchet.py``.

The ratchet exists because ``F401`` cannot be enabled as a *lint* rule on this
repo: 456 findings would have to be resolved one by one, and three measured
attempts to automate that (a static scanner over six-plus consumption channels)
each ended in a full revert.  A ratchet gets the value -- growth is blocked --
without taking the risk.

These tests pin the behaviour that makes the ratchet meaningful:

* the real tree is at baseline, so the gate is actually green rather than
  skipped;
* **growth fails** -- proved by mutation, because a guard that cannot fail is
  not a guard;
* a missing baseline is a hard error, not a silent pass;
* the baseline is LF-only (it is a generated artifact; see the 2026-09-22 N1
  defect where ``Path.write_text`` silently rewrote a repo file as CRLF);
* per-file baselines, so a reduction in one file cannot mask growth in another.
